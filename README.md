# Automate you daily task with PowerShell-Script

During my time in Higashifuji, I used to have a lot of routine.
Every morning, I will open up 3 applications before we start out a brief morning meeting.

In this example, I make 3 option for the task. 
So this is a sample of script that you may use;

Once done with the script, please save it in C directory using any name that you waant to. For me, I saved it as AppLauncher.
